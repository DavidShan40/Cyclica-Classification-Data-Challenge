## Background

* The Cyclica Data Science Challenge focuses on the application of machine learning and data science techniques in the field of drug discovery. The primary goal of this challenge is to develop predictive models that can efficiently identify the targets of small molecule drugs and facilitate the drug development process. The challenge aims to encourage the development of innovative solutions that can help identify and optimize potential drug candidates, thereby shortening the time required for drug development and reducing the overall costs.

* Cyclica, the host of this challenge, is a leading biotechnology company that leverages artificial intelligence and computational biophysics to develop next-generation medicines. Their advanced platforms empower researchers to design better drugs and unlock the potential of the genome. By hosting this competition, Cyclica seeks to foster collaboration and innovation in the field of drug discovery, ultimately contributing to the development of new and effective therapies for patients worldwide.

## Description

* Participants in the challenge are provided with a dataset consisting of small molecule drugs and their targets. The dataset also includes various molecular features and properties associated with each drug. The primary objective is to develop machine learning models capable of predicting the targets of small molecule drugs based on these features. The submitted models will be evaluated on their accuracy, as well as their potential for real-world application in the drug discovery process.

## Methods

* Data Exploration

  * Visualize compound structure and protein sequence data
  * Analyze data distribution and identify trends and patterns
* Data Preprocessing

  * Convert chemical structures and protein sequences into suitable representations for machine learning models
  * Normalize and scale data features
  * Handle missing values and outliers
* Data Modeling

  * Split data into train/test sets for model evaluation and comparison
  * Compare various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM
  * Optimize model hyperparameters and perform feature selection for improved performance
  * Validate the final model using cross-validation techniques
  * Analyze model performance and interpret results

## Solution

Our team, M3 Biubiubiu, tackled the challenge by implementing a series of data transformations, feature engineering techniques, and experimenting with various machine learning models. Through our efforts, we managed to significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the drug-target interactions.

### Key Achievements
